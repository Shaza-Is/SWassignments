Chapter Review
--------------
1. What is a class?
..*class is a user defined type
*class in C++ includes private data members and public function members **methods**
2. How does a class accomplish abstraction, encapsulation, and data hiding?
..*abstraction: by hiding the details of implementation
..*encapsulation: by combining the data to methods to manipulate them, so the data is accessed except by using those methods.
..*data hiding: by making data members private/protected, so they are protected from outside world **other functions or classes**
3. What is the relationship between an object and a class?
..*an object is an instance of a class
4. In what way, aside from being functions, are class function members different from class data members?
..*class function members are usually public while data members are usually private
5. Define a class to represent a bank account. Data members should include the depositor’s name, the account number (use a string), and the balance. Member functions should allow the following:
⋅⋅1. Creating an object and initializing it.
⋅⋅2. Displaying the depositor’s name, account number, and balance
⋅⋅3. Depositing an amount of money given by an argument
⋅⋅4. Withdrawing an amount of money given by an argument
Just show the class declaration, not the method implementations. (Programming Exercise 1 provides you with an opportunity to write the implementation.)
